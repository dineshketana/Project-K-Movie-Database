# üé¨ Project Title: Movie Database Management System

## üìÑ Abstract

This project focuses on developing a **Movie Database Management System** using **Python** and **SQL**. The system is designed to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve information about movies, including details like titles, genres, release years, directors, and actors. It provides functionalities for adding new movies, updating existing records, deleting entries, and querying the database for specific information. The project aims to demonstrate the integration of Python programming with SQL databases to create a functional and user-friendly application for managing movie data.
